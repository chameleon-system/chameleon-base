UPGRADE FROM 7.0 to 7.1
=======================

# Essentials

The steps in this chapter are required to get the project up and running in version 7.1.
It is recommended to follow these steps in the given order.

## Prepare Project

Be sure to install (locally) the latest release of the Chameleon 7.0.x branch before continuing migrating.

Logout from the Chameleon backend.

## Adjust Composer Dependencies

In `composer.json`, adjust version constraints for all Chameleon dependencies from `~7.0.0` to `~7.1.0` and run
`composer update`.

If your project requires `sensio/generator-bundle`, then remove it as the bundle has no support for symfony 4. You will
also need to remove `\Sensio\Bundle\DistributionBundle\SensioDistributionBundle` and 
`\Sensio\Bundle\GeneratorBundle\SensioGeneratorBundle` from your `AppKernel`.

Remove `\Doctrine\Bundle\DoctrineCacheBundle\DoctrineCacheBundle` from your AppKernel as well.

## Update your config*.yml

If you are referencing parameters via `%parametername%` in your config files, you will need to make sure that these parameters
are quoted.

## Upgrade you scripts section

In `composer.json`, change the following lines under `symfony-scripts`

```
"Sensio\\Bundle\\DistributionBundle\\Composer\\ScriptHandler::clearCache",
"Sensio\\Bundle\\DistributionBundle\\Composer\\ScriptHandler::installAssets",
"Sensio\\Bundle\\DistributionBundle\\Composer\\ScriptHandler::prepareDeploymentTarget"
```

to:

```
"app/console cache:clear",
"app/console assets:install --symlink --relative web"
```

Then remove the line

`"ChameleonSystem\\DistributionBundle\\VersionCheck\\PostUpdateVersionCheck::checkVersion"`

from the `post-update-cmd` section.

## Regenerate Autoclasses And Run Updates

Regenerate autoclasses by calling the console command `app/console chameleon_system:autoclasses:generate`.
Execute the updates by calling the console command `app/console chameleon_system:update:run`.

## Add A Tag To Mappers

All mappers (classes inheriting from AbstractViewMapper) must now be tagged with `chameleon_system.mapper` if they are defined
as service.

## Make Legacy Services Public

All service classes that are loaded by `ServiceLocator::get()` must now be `public="true"` in their service definitions.
