CHANGELOG For 7.0.x
===================

Chameleon 7.0.x is almost functionally identical to Chameleon 6.3.x. As of our backwards compatibility policy, we
strive to make code changes in minor releases in a way that preserves backwards compatibility. A major release then
removes the compatibility layer.

Other changes in this release are only minor but breaking changes. See the UPGRADE guide for information.
