UPGRADE FROM 7.1 to 7.2
=======================

# Essentials

The steps in this chapter are required to get the project up and running in version 7.2.
It is recommended to follow these steps in the given order.

## Change Or Remove Deprecated Code (Symfony)

You must change some code which was deprecated in previous Symfony versions and is now removed. Do this now with a working
Chameleon 7.1 project. Any change should also be working with "old" Symfony 4.4.

### List Of Removed Or Changed Code

- Configuration classes: TreeBuilder must be constructed with an argument. (search for new TreeBuilder())
- Event dispatcher: The argument order is swapped. (search for ->dispatch( )
- Session: Instead of `getSession()` `hasSession()` should be used for a null check. (search for ->getSession( with a following null check)
- Some event classes have been renamed. Especially FilterResponseEvent, GetResponseEvent and GetRequestEvent.
- Also note that the event class should match the event type (i.e. RequestEvent for "kernel.request").
- Change the event base class to \Symfony\Contracts\EventDispatcher\Event.
- The namespace of the TranslatorInterface changed to Symfony\Contracts\Translation\TranslatorInterface.
- Take care that all yaml string values have quotes. For example in any config.yml.

This list might not be complete. Also take a look at the official Symfony migration documentation:

## Adjust Composer Dependencies

In `composer.json`, adjust version constraints for all Chameleon dependencies from `~7.1.0` to `~7.2.0` and run
`composer update`.

# Changed Features

## Property modifier restrictions

- \ChameleonSystem\CoreBundle\Controller\ChameleonController::$moduleLoader
  (public â†’ protected) a getter getModuleLoader() for direct access was added; a magic getter was added to produce deprecation message

## Deprecated auto-flushing

The function for early flushing content to the browser is deprecated (ChameleonController::FlushContentToBrowser()).
You should simply be able to remove respective calls in your code.
If this poses a (perceived) performance problem at all other optimization effort should be done.

# Removed Features

- \ChameleonSystem\CoreBundle\Controller\ChameleonController::PreOutputCallbackFunctionReplaceCustomVars()

# Newly Deprecated Code Entities

## Services

- \ChameleonSystem\CoreBundle\Controller\ChameleonNoAutoFlushController

## Constants

- CHAMELEON_ENABLE_FLUSHING

## Methods

- \ChameleonSystem\CoreBundle\Controller\ChameleonController::getBlockAutoFlushToBrowser()
- \ChameleonSystem\CoreBundle\Controller\ChameleonController::PreOutputCallbackFunction()
- \ChameleonSystem\CoreBundle\Controller\ChameleonController::SetBlockAutoFlushToBrowser()
- \ChameleonSystem\CoreBundle\Controller\ChameleonControllerInterface::FlushContentToBrowser()
