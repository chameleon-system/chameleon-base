// To override CoreUI variables add them to chameleon's custom variables file imported below.
// Please note that all variables defined in 'chameleon/variables' might be overridden by the original CoreUI sources
// unless the CoreUI theme marks them as a fallback with `!default`. This is the case i.e. for `$sidebar-width`.
@import 'chameleon/variables';

// Importing CoreUi
@import '../../../../../../../../../../coreui/coreui/scss/coreui-standalone';

// Import any other styles below.
//@import './chameleon/example';

// Please note to leave a blank line at the end of this file. Thus this file will end with a line break. This is required
// to pass lint tests.
