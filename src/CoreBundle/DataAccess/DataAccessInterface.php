 * DataAccessInterface defines a generic service that reads data from a data source.

 * 1. There are lots of reads on single items, so that bulk reading is more efficient than reading every item independently.
 * 2. There is a cache mechanism for the fetched data, to avoid reading rather large datasets from the backend.
 * 3. There are higher-level services that operate on the fetched data. The returned values should be quite raw, so more
 *    sophisticated usage requires additional work.
