/**
 * Loads a template from a string. In the Chameleon System this class is only used in case a template could not be
 * found. We can then display the template name so that developers can more easily locate errors.
 *
 * The class is taken from Twig 1.x, the original docblock follows.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * This loader should NEVER be used. It only exists for Twig internal purposes.
 *
 * When using this loader with a cache mechanism, you should know that a new cache
 * key is generated each time a template content "changes" (the cache key being the
 * source code of the template). If you don't want to see your cache grows out of
 * control, you need to take care of clearing the old cache file by yourself.
