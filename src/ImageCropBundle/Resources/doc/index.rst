Cropped Images
==============

It's possible to crop images directly in the media manager or image fields and use the resulting cutouts in templates.

Installation
------------

- Add `new \ChameleonSystem\ImageCropBundle\ChameleonSystemImageCropBundle()` to the AppKernel.
- Add a symlink inside `customer/src/extensions/snippets-cms/` pointing to `vendor/chameleon-system/chameleon-base/src/ImageCropBundle/Resources/views/snippets-cms/imageCrop`.
To extend templates, symlinks have to be changed accordingly.
- Add a symlink inside `customer/src/extensions/objectviews/TCMSFields` (create directory if needed) pointing to `vendor/chameleon-system/chameleon-base/src/ImageCropBundle/Resources/views/objectviews/TCMSFields/TCMSFieldMediaWithImageCrop`
- Run CMS updates.
- Run assets:install console command.
- Clear Symfony cache.

Presets
-------

You can define presets for common image formats in `cms_image_crop_preset`. Users can choose these presets when creating
cutouts.

Field Type
----------

To use cropped images for an image field, change the field type to `Image with crop`. This will allow to choose or create
a cutout. The ID of the crop is provided in the autoclass (e.g. fieldCmsMediaIdImageCropId).

You can restrict to certain presets by setting `imageCropPresetRestrictionSystemNames` in the field config or define a
default preset with `imageCropPresetSystemName`.

Twig
----

Use the twig filters in \ChameleonSystem\ImageCropBundle\Twig\CropImageExtension to show the cropped images. There are
different options:

- Show a specific crop by providing a crop ID or preset (imageUrlWithCropFallbackPreset)
- Show a specific crop by providing a crop ID or fixed size (imageUrlWithCropFallbackSize)
- Show a specific crop, but scale and crop it to a fixed size (imageUrlWithCropSize)

If preset or size is provided, the corresponding crop is automatically selected. If there is no crop that fits, image is
cropped from the center.
