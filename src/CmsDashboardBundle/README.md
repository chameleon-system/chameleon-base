# CmsDashboarBundle

This bundle provides a dashboard for the CMS. It is a collection of widgets that can be configured by the user. 
The widgets are selected by a service tag: 
`<tag name="chameleon_system.dashboard_widget" collection="analytics" priority="15" />?`.
See the `ChameleonSystem\CmsDashboardBundle\Bridge\Chameleon\Dashboard\Widgets\DashboardExampleWidget` for an example.
